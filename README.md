# Mental Health Awareness Survey


## Overview

The **Mental Health Awareness Survey** is a web-based application designed to gather information and increase awareness about mental health issues. It aims to provide users with an opportunity to express their views and experiences related to mental health, contributing to a broader understanding and fostering community support.

The application consists of four primary pages:
- `index.html`: The homepage of the survey, providing an overview and introduction.
- `survey.html`: The main page where users can fill out the mental health survey.
- `confirm.html`: A confirmation page that appears after survey submission.
- `404.html`: An error page for handling incorrect URLs.

## UX

#### Color Scheme

- **Page Header Color:** The page header is styled with a vibrant green (#4CAF50), symbolizing growth, health, and a refreshing atmosphere. This color choice is ideal for a platform focused on health awareness and education.

- **Personalized User Recommendations**: Implement a function that analyzes the user responses from the survey and generates tailored advice or suggestions. This will enhance user engagement by providing customized feedback based on individual inputs and preferences.

I conducted thorough testing of each page using various tools to ensure the website functions correctly and meets quality standards.
#### Index Page:

- **HTML Validator:** The HTML structure was validated using W3C HTML Validator. The result was "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
